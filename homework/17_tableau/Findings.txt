My story on Citi Bikes uses data from March, June, September, and December 
of 2017 through 2019. The visualizations depict user gender, age, and type with respect to 
weekday popularity, yearly and monthly growth, and station use.

Two findings: 

-- Weekday Ridership -- 
Male riders' number of rides appears to be the inverse of riders who did not 
specify their gender: male riders ride often on weekdays, perhaps to commute to work, but 
subsequently drop off on weekends; rides taken by users of unknown gender dip on weekdays 
and have upticks on weekends. In terms of trip duration, though, unknown riders dramatically
spike to just exceed the level of male riders. So customers who don't list their gender 
take more rides of longer duration on weekends. Women ride pretty consistently throughout the
week, but do also increase in trip duration on weekends.

-- Growth --
Citi Bike's service is mainly used by subscribers and an increasing number of rides are also
being taken by casual customers. Breaking down the rides by month, though, shows recent
declines in the months of June and December. Though they may be due to unusual weather or 
other factors, Citi Bikes should pay attention to any continuation of this decline in the 
coming year; if rides by subscribers coninue to dip, overall growth will take a hit since
our base is so dependent on this user type.
